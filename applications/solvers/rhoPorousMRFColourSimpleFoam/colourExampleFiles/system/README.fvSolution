// Changes to be able to run with colour source
// are adding solver selection for the colour field.
// Multigrid does not seem to work well.
// If using the "macros" (Niklas Wikstroms cases) e.g:


    colour
    {
        $smoothSolver;
    }

// One could also try adding relaxation to the colour field:

relaxationFactors
{

    ...

    equations
    {
        colour      0.5;
    }
}
