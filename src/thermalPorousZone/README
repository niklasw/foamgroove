This is the source code for a modified version of the thermalPorousZone
library. The original library source code is

$FOAM_SRC/thermophysicalModels/thermalPorousZone

This modified library adds classes for simplified heat exchanger modeling.
The added classes (or models) are "heatSource" and "simpleHeatExchanger", both
are based on the "fixedTemperature" thermalModel.

INSTALLATION
============

Put this folder in e.g. $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-2.1.x/src/, so that the path
to this README becomes $HOME/OpenFOAM/$USER-2.1.x/src/thermalPorousZone/README

The location of the source is not important. It can be placed anywhere, as
long as the content is unchanged.

To have the compiled library in its default path, just run

    wmake libso

A successful compile will result in the shared library
$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN/libthermalPorousZone.so

In this way, two verisons of libthermalPorousZone.so will exist; the original
OpenFOAM variant, and this modified variant. The suggested install path will
make this modified variant to take precedence over the original.

To change the installation location, edit the last line of Make/files found
in this folder.
