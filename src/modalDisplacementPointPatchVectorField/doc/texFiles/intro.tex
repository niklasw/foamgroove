\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

In this document we present a method for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulation
(see~\cite{DH:1} for a not very good review of the research area).
We describe both the theoretical formulation of the method, its implementation
and its verification for test problems.

The method relies on a modal description of the structure, which is performed
as a pre-processing step. Then the actual FSI-simulation is carred out in
an \texttt{OpenFOAM}-solver which includes functionality for the modal deformation
of the structure and its (time-resolved) coupling to the fluid motion.

The choice for structural solver for the initial test cases is \texttt{Comsol}.
This may be revised at a later stage of developments.

In section~\ref{sec:theory}, we describe the theory of the method,
in section~\ref{sec:impl}, we describe its implementation, and, in section~\ref{sec:tests},
we describe its verification for test cases.
