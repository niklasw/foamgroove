Please read header of oceanWaveInletPhase/oceanWaveInletPhaseFvPatchScalarField.H

To use the oceanWaves library, build it in an OpenFOAM-2.3.x environment:

    > wmake libso

Then force interFoam to load the library runtime by adding the following line to
case/system/controlDict:

    libs ("liboceanWaves.so");
